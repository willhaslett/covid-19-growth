# covid-19-growth

The [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data)
and the [Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)
are providing daily Covid-19 case
count files. This pipeline:
- Imports the NYT and JHU data
- Performs type conversions where needed
- Adds demographic data
- Outputs the resulting data structures as a set of long-format time series.

The latest NYT and JHU files are pulled from GitHub at runtime. All data operations are vectorized. All data from 2020-01-21 to the present are imported whenever you generate new CSV, JSON, or Pickle files. This assures that all revisions to JHU or NYT raw files will be included here.

## Usage

### What do I get?
Two sets of output data are constructed at runtime, one for all global data and one for all US data.
The US data are parsed and demographic data are added.
The NYT and JHU US data are available separately and as a combined time series.

The three output formats, Pandas, CSV and JSON, all contain the same data, with the dataframes and CSV files
having the same tabular format, and the JSON files structured by the
[pandas.DataFrame.to_json](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_json.html) function.

- Global data (JHU)
  - df_all_cases
  - df_all_deaths 
- US data
  - df_us_jhu
  - df_us_nyt
  - df_us_combined

### Global Data
`c19all.py`
* **`df_all`** A dictionary containing dataframes with all global data for cases, deaths, and recoveries. `province_state` has mixed types, as it does upstream.
  ```
  print(df_all['cases'])

              date  day  cases         province_state                country        lat        long

  ```

* **Functions**
  - `filter(df, column, vlaue)` Generic filter
  - `for_country(df, country)` Filter by country
  - `for_province_state(df, province_state)` Filter by province_state
  - `sum_by_date(df)` Group by date and sum case counts 

### US Data
The three output US data structures all have the same basic shape.
Note however that whereas the NYT time series starts on 2020-01-21, the JHU time series
starts on 2020-03-22, the date when JHU changed the format of their US data.
`date` and `fips` are used as a multindex in Pandas, and these are added as columns
in the CSV and JSON files.

`c19us_jhu.df_us` and `c19us_nyt.df_us` are combined in `c19us_combined` as shown below.
Here, the suffixes `_nyt`and `_jhu` are added to the case and death data.
```
>>> from c19us_combined import df_us
>>> print(df_us)    
                   day      county       state          sub_region   region          lat          long  cases_nyt  deaths_nyt  cases_jhu  deaths_jhu  recovered  active

## CSV and JSON
`dump_csv_and_json.py`
Creates CSV and JSON files for the five Pandas dataframes. Data are synchronized with the upstream repos at runtime.

- **CSV:**
  Comma-delimited files for each dataframe. The formats mirror the dataframes as described above.

- **JSON:**
  JavaScript Object Notation files for each dataframe. Files are constructed using the `orient='table'` argument for 
  [pandas.DataFrame.to_json](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.to_json.html).
  Choose a different structure for the JSON files by setting `JSON_ORIENT`. JSON files are minified by default. For not-minified JSON, set `JSON_INDENT` to > 0.

## Jupyter Notebooks
  
  `all.ipynb` and `us.ipynb` contain starting points for work with global or US data. You can preview the notebook stubs here in GitHub by navigating to them:
  
  [Cases in Japan since 2020-01-21](https://github.com/willhaslett/covid-19-growth/blob/master/notebooks/all.ipynb)
  
  [Deaths in New England since 2020-03-01](https://github.com/willhaslett/covid-19-growth/blob/master/notebooks/us.ipynb)

## Firebase
### Prerequisites
  - [Create your Firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/) and add a Firestore database.
  - Create and download a private key JSON file for your project. (Project settings > Service accounts)
  - Rename the downladed file to `.google_service_account_key.json` and put it in the project root. This file will be ignored by Git.

### Usage
`python lib/upload_to_firestore.py`

 Currently, this script uploads the combined US data structure to Firestore using the following scheme: 
  1. A schema document that defines the column names for the associated data documents
    ![](.images/db_columns.png)
  1. A collection of data documents, split by date, with all data for a date stored in a single JSON string
    ![](.images/db_data.png)
  3. A document containing the available additional data for all counties in the dataset, keyed by fips code
